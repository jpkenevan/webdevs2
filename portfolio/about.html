                                I was born on February 2nd, 2001 at a hospital in the west side of Chicago, Illinois. I was raised in the Belmont-Cragin Neighborhood my whole life. We moved once during my lifetime, which was from our previous home in the Belmont-Cragin area to the house we currently inhabit. I can barely remember the old house because we moved when I was like 4 years old, which was just before my little brother, Jake, was born. I have two brothers, Edward, who is 20 years old, and Jake, who is 11 years old. I’m currently 15 years old and attend Lane Tech High School for my sophomore year, but I’ve attended Lane for almost 4 years now. I was able to transfer from my neighborhood school, Mary Lyon Elementary School, after 6th grade to Lane through the LTAC program. In order to attend LTAC, I had to take an assessment at IIT that would test if I was suited to be a LTAC student. I spent my 7th and 8th grade year assimilating into Lane through the LTAC program, which offered high school level courses to middle school students. By my Freshman year, I was taking sophomore and junior level classes as well as AP classes. I believe that this opportunity at Lane has molded my live as a student and a person. I have learned many morals, lessons, and I’ve been given immense amounts of knowledge that surely will prepare me for many years to come.

                                My goals as a creator are to gain knowledge and apply that knowledge to my work in order to create more convenient and useful tools that can benefit others. I want to be a efficient and motivated creator with a purpose. My purpose as a developer is to make the world a better place and make people happy. I want to make people's lives simpler and less stressful in order to induce happiness upon those who need it.
